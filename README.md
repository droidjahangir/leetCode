### Singly Linked List

### Doubly linked list 
![doubly linked list](./doubly-linked-list.png)

- singly linked list is useful for insertion and deletion, because singly linked list need less memory compared to doubly linked list. 

- doubly linked list is useful for traverse and searching.  

### stack
![stack](./stack.png)
pick() method just pick top element.

**Array will be suitable for stack implementation**

### queue
![queue](./queue.png)
here pick() method just pick first element. 

**Linked list will be best suitable for queue implementation, because when we enqueue or dequeue an element from an array,
 then all element should be shift from its original position. It will cost O(n) time complexity on the other hand Linked list will cost O(1) time complexity, but it will take some memory.**
