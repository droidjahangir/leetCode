### Singly Linked List

### Doubly linked list 
![doubly linked list](./images/doubly-linked-list.png)

- singly linked list is useful for insertion and deletion, because singly linked list need less memory compared to doubly linked list. 

- doubly linked list is useful for traverse and searching.  

### stack
![stack](./images/stack.png)
pick() method just pick top element.

**Array will be suitable for stack implementation**

### queue
![queue](./images/queue.png)
here pick() method just pick first element. 

**Linked list will be the best suitable for queue implementation, because when we enqueue or dequeue an element from an array,
 then all element should be shifted from its original position. It will cost O(n) time complexity on the other hand Linked list will cost O(1) time complexity, but it will take some memory.**
 
 ### Tree
 ![tree](./images/tree.png)
 In binary search tree values which are less than root node exist in left tree and bigger values are exist in right. 
 
 **Balanced binary search tree**
 ![Balanced binary search tree](./images/balanced-binary-search-tree.png)
 binary search trees value are already in sorted order.
 
 **Unbalanced binary search tree**
 ![Unbalanced binary search tree](./images/unbalanced-tree.png)
 Balanced binary search tree gives us O(log N) complexity but unbalanced tree gives us O(n) time complexity but some algorithms help us to reduce complexity 
 
 AVL tree, Red-Black tree, B-tree algorithms turned unbalanced to balanced tree, then complexity reduced to O(log N)
